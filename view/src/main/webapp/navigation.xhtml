                            <li>A <strong>competition</strong> titled e.g., "Kode gubbz gaming night" comprises one or several <strong>games</strong> (e.g., Bowling, StarCraft).</li>
                            <li>Each game contains several <strong>matches</strong>. In these matches, every team competes against each other exactly once.</li>

                        <h3>Time-based Games:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If the game's scoring is based on time (e.g., fastest lap in a car game), the team with the least cumulative time wins the match. This is based on the combined times of all players in a team.</li>
                            <li>The team with the least total time receives 100 points, followed by 90 points for the next least time, and so on.</li>

                        <h3>Score-based Games:</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If the game's scoring is determined by a score (e.g., total pins in bowling), the team with the highest cumulative score wins the match. This is calculated from the scores of all players in the team.</li>
                            <li>The team with the highest total score gets 100 points, followed by 90 points for the next highest score, and so on.</li>

                            <li>The overall score is derived from the cumulative score of each team across all <strong>games</strong>.</li>
                            <li>In instances where teams have uneven member counts, the score for each <strong>match</strong> will be determined by average.</li>
                            <li>For example, if one team has 3 members and another has 2, scores will be averaged based on 3 players for the first team and 2 players for the second.</li>
